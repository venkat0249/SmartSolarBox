Introduction:
The smart solar box is composed of a power system and an information system. Both work together to provide you all the services you need such as portable energy, monitoring and control. The Smart Solar Box's power system is what is a known as a stand-alone photovoltaic system. It has three main elements: a solar panel (or array of panels), a battery and a charge controller. The solar panel absorbs solar radiation and turns it into direct-current electricity. The battery stores this energy. The controller is in charge of optimizing the operation of the solar panel, charging and discharging the battery, and providing the electricity of the previous two elements to consumers.

The smart controller consists of an information system that is responsible for communicating with the charge controller and relaying that information to the user in a friendly way. The information system also gives wi-fi capabilities to the Smart Solar Box. The main aim of this python tool is create such information system.
